---

## ü§ó Getting Started

### Get the project

First, you need to download the project in your computer and install all the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrandvauxClement/YoPortoflio-FrontEnd.git frontEnd
cd frontEnd
npm install
```

### Add environment variables

You have to create a .env file at the root of the project (directly under the server folder) :

```dotenv
####### COMMUNICATION WITH THE SERVER

# the URL of the server
# we need it to communicate with the server

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:9000

```

### Run the client

Then, you can run the development client:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the running client.
